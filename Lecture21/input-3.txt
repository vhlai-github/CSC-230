Input 3
Here is another input file.
It's also not a multiple of
8 bytes in length, however
the password we're going to
use with it also isn't exactly
8 bytes, so you'll have to
pad it.

This file also shows a problem
with the Electronic Code Book
(ECB) technique we're using
to encrypt.  Each block is
encrypted independently, so
two duplicate blocks will
encrypt to the same thing, no
matter what the key is.

For example, the following will
encrypt to another copy of the
first block:

Input 3

There are ways to fix this, by
folding some part of a previous
block into the encryption of
each successive block.
