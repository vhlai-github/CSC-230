This is a test input file for our resizable array exercise.
I want it to be long enough that we get a few reallocations while
reading the file.  So, I have to fill space.  What to talk about ...

I know.  I'll talk about C.  It's a good language. It gives us
access to three memory regions (static, stack and heap).  The
program that processes this file is a good opportunity to practice
working with heap.

I know a person who likes to say "C is the new assembly language."
His point was that, for many applications, C gets us close enough to
the hardware that we don't need to code directly in assembly.  Of
course, it's still useful to be able to work in assembly.  We may have
to write a few performance-critical or hardware-dependent parts of an
application or an operating system with some code in assembly.  Also,
knowing some assembly gives us insight into what we're really doing
when we program in a higher-level language.

(Although, really, I'd rather be programming in C++.  It lets us
work like C programmers when we need to, and it gives us access
to object orientation, generics, namespaces and other features that
make it easier to develop large-scale programs.  We'll spend some
time on C++ at the end of the semester, but we'll just have time
to hit the highlights.)
